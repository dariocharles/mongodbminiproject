PROBLEM #1 - CONNECT TO FLASK - Do test
DO TEST FOR APP.PY

TESTING - Put name and everything the sign up regirster page and go to mongodb cluster to double check it has registed.

-add other log in informtaion - like a phone number ?
-Registration 2-3 fields to the registration pagwe - phone number, email, address, do you want to receive email description
-when logged in - get the user information to be displayed so we can pull it??? Clarify 
-display user profile page - and then have the crud functionality so the user can update, delete?

Optional:
If you are done and would like to practice further from the mini project, you can try adding the following things:
- More components on the registration form adding more entries to the database
- Displaying the new data on the user profile from the database
- Adding update ability on the user profile page to allow the user to change information stored in the database


install flask - pip3 install Flask

for env.py file -
got to - https://randomkeygen.com/ and get a random key


NEED FOR HEROKU!
pip3 freeze --local >requirements.txt
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
(If this command creates a second blank line in the Procfile delete the second line cuz may cause problems with heroku)
Go to heroku and create new app. 


test - python3 app.py
