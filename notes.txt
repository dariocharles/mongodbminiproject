PROBLEM #1 - CONNECT TO FLASK - Do test
DO TEST FOR APP.PY


install flask - pip3 install Flask

for env.py file -
got to - https://randomkeygen.com/ and get a random key


NEED FOR HEROKU!
pip3 freeze --local >requirements.txt
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
(If this command creates a second blank line in the Procfile delete the second line cuz may cause problems with heroku)
Go to heroku and create new app. 


test - python3 app.py
